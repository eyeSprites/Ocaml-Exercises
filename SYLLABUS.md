## Course Description

This bootcamp provides hands-on experience with program analysis techniques used in modern software development. Students learn to build tools that automatically analyze code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. The course covers foundational theory, AST-based code representation, and static analysis techniques including dataflow analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** the fundamental concepts of static and dynamic program analysis
2. **Design** and implement AST traversal and transformation algorithms
3. **Construct** control flow graphs from source code
4. **Apply** the dataflow analysis framework using lattices, transfer functions, and fixpoint computation
5. **Evaluate** trade-offs between different analysis approaches (soundness, completeness, scalability)
6. **Implement** reaching definitions and live variables analyses

## Course Schedule

### Week 2: Code Representation (6 hours)
**Module 2: Code Representation and ASTs**
- Theory: Abstract Syntax Trees
